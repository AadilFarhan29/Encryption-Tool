# Encryption Tool 

Encryption script essentially scans through files in the directory, excluding certain files from encryption, generates a key, encrypts each eligible file's contents, and saves the key for potential decryption later.
Decryption script performs decryption of files previously encrypted using Fernet encryption. 

# Installation 

Python: The script is written in Python, so you need to have Python installed on your system. You can download Python from the official website: https://www.python.org/downloads/

1. Check python version
  ```python3 --version```

2. If Python is not installed, you can install it using your package manager. For example, on Ubuntu, you can install Python with the following command:

   ```
   sudo apt-get update
   sudo apt-get install python3
   ```

3. Git clone

# Usage 
It is important to note that, It will only Encrypt and Decrypt the files that are present inside the same file as the python files. 

1. Encrypting the files
   ```python3 Encryption.py```
2. Decrypting the files

   Secret Code : 707
